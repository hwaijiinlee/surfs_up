# Analysis of Temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii
The purpose of the analysis is to determine if the weather in Oahu is conducive to sustain a surf and ice-cream shop year-round.

## Results
We retrieved the temperatures in Oahu in June and December and obtained summary statistics of those two months below:

![december image](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/surfs_up/blob/main/december_temps.png)

- The mean temperatures in both June and December are very close 75F and 71F respectively. This is great weather for ice-cream sales
- The lowest temperature in December though is much colder than in June 56F vs 64F. This could mean that ice-cream sales in December could be much lower than in June although surfing-wise, 56F still might be tolerable
- The maximum temperatures in both June and December are very close as well 85F and 83F respectively. Again, great temperatures for both surfing and ice-cream

## Summary
Based on the above analysis, it does look like the temperate weather in Oahu is favorable for having a surf and ice-cream shop year-round.
However, temperature alone does not give a complete picture of the weather in Oahu. We should also obtain the following additional weather information for a better analysis:
- precipitation in June and December; and
- identify the most active weather station closest to the planned surf and ice-cream shop to retrieve the temperatures and precipitation from that weather station instead to get a more accurate idea of the weather close to the location of the planned shop.
